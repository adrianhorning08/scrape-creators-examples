Sample projects you can accomplish with the Scrape Creators API.

Will slowly be adding more projects here.

# Getting Started

```bash
npm install
```

## API Key

You'll need an API key to use the Scrape Creators API.

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your API key:

```bash
SCRAPECREATORS_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

You can get one by signing up on the [Scrape Creators app](https://app.scrapecreators.com).

## Running the scripts

Then simply run whatever script you're interested in.
For example, to get trending songs and their tiktoks:

```bash
node getTrendingSongs.js
```
